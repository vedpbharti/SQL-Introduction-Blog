## Introduction to Windows Functions

A Windows function, also known as an analytic function, operates on a specific subset of rows called a window or a frame. It allows us to perform calculations across this window, providing insights into the data distribution and relationships within a result set.

## Syntax and Usage

Windows functions are typically used in conjunction with the `OVER` clause, which defines the window or frame over which the function operates. The `OVER` clause specifies the partitioning and ordering of the rows within the window.

## Commonly Used Windows Functions

### ROW_NUMBER()

The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique sequential number to each row within a partition, without any gaps or duplicates.

### RANK()

The `RANK()` function assigns a unique rank to each row within a partition, with the same ranks for rows with equal values. It leaves gaps in the ranking sequence when there are ties.

### DENSE_RANK()

The `DENSE_RANK()` function assigns a unique rank to each row within a partition, with the same ranks for rows with equal values. Unlike `RANK()`, it does not leave gaps in the ranking sequence.

### LEAD()

The `LEAD()` function allows you to access the value of a column from the next row within the window, based on a specified offset.

### LAG()

The `LAG()` function allows you to access the value of a column from the previous row within the window, based on a specified offset.

## Examples

Let's dive into some practical examples to understand the application of Windows functions.

### Calculating Running Total

Suppose we have a sales table with columns `OrderDate` and `Revenue`. We can use the `SUM()` function with the `OVER` clause to calculate the running total of revenue over time.

```sql
SELECT OrderDate, Revenue, SUM(Revenue) OVER (ORDER BY OrderDate) AS RunningTotal
FROM SalesTable;
